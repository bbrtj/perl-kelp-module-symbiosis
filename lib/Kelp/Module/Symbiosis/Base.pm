=head1 NAME

Kelp::Module::Symbiosis::Base - base class for symbiotic modules

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	package Kelp::Module::MyModule;

	use Kelp::Base qw(Kelp::Module::Symbiosis::Base);

	sub psgi
	{
		# write code that returns psgi application without middlewares
	}

	sub build
	{
		my ($self, %args) = @_;
		$self->SUPER::build(%args);

		# write initialization code as usual
	}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module serves as a base for a Kelp module that is supposed to be ran as a standalone Plack application (mounted separately). It takes care of middleware management, mounting into Symbiosis manager and some basic initialization chores. To write a new module that introduces a standalone Plack application as a Kelp module, simply extend this class and override I<psgi> and I<build> methods.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 run

	sig: run($self)

Calls I<psgi()> and wraps its contents in middlewares. Returns a Plack application.

=head2 psgi

	sig: psgi($self, @more_data)

By default, this method will throw an exception. It has to be replaced with an actual application producing code in the child class. The resulting application will be wrapped in middlewares from config in I<run()>.

=head2 build

	sig: build($self, %args)

Standard Kelp module building method. When reimplementing it's best to call parent's implementation, as middleware initialization happens in base implementation.

=head2 middleware

	sig: middleware($self)

Returns an array containing all the middlewares in format: C<[ middleware_class, { middleware_config } ]>. By default, this config comes from module configuration.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

example configuration could look like this (for L<Kelp::Module::WebSocket::AnyEvent>):

	modules => [qw/JSON Symbiosis WebSocket::AnyEvent/],
	modules_init => {
		Symbiosis => {
			automount => 0, # kelp will be mounted manually under different path
		},
		"WebSocket::AnyEvent" => {
			serializer => "json",
			middleware => [qw/Recorder/],
			middleware_init => {
				Recorder => { output => "~/recorder.out" },
			}
		},
	}

=head2 middleware, middleware_init

Middleware specs for this application. Every module basing on this class can specify its own set of middlewares. They are configured exactly the same as middlewares in Kelp. There's currently no standarized way to retrieve middleware configurations from Kelp into another application, so custom code is needed if such need arise.
