=head1 NAME

KelpX::Symbiosis::Engine::URLMap - Default engine implementation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a reimplementation of L<KelpX::Symbiosis::Engine> using
L<Plack::App::URLMap> as a runner. It's pretty straightforward and mounts Kelp
as just one of the apps in the ecosystem (not giving it any special treatment).

=head1 CAVEATS

=head2 Symbiosis paths will always have priority over Kelp routes
